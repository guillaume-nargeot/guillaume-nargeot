Welcome to my blog, *Monadic Ripples*, in which I will mostly write about programming related topics.

This blog is meant to be a revival of the [previous blogspot one](http://guillaume-nargeot.blogspot.com/ "Previous blog on blogspot") that I stopped updating already more than 3 years ago.
In this new version, I will use Jekyll with GitHub Pages, which I think makes many things simpler.

In the next few weeks, I will try to import the posts from that previous blog, explaining why some posts are older than this one.

For other information, please refer to my [GitHub](http://github.com/guillaume-nargeot "My GitHub profile") and [LinkedIn](http://jp.linkedin.com/in/guillaumenargeot/ "My LinkedIn profile") profiles.

You can also find me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/killy971 "My Twitter profile") and [500x](http://500px.com/GuillaumeNargeot "My 500px profile").
